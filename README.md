F# Compiler Service
===================

The F# compiler services package contains a custom build of the F# compiler that
exposes additional functionality for implementing F# language bindings, additional
tools based on the compiler or refactoring tools. The package also includes F# 
interactive service that can be used for embedding F# scripting into your applications.
